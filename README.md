Libraries needed to download:

-  Also if it does not work remember to change the "Minipiano.png" to "miniPiano.png" or sometimes vice versa.
  
We created a music creator app which essentially lets the user click or press they mouse keys to recreate sounds of an instrument. The user can choose various different instruments in the homescreen; the options are drumset, piano, and guitar. We also have a metronome to let the user stay on beat on whatever music they are recreating and the metronome gives options to slow or fasten the BPM. Also some instrumenst may retain a special buttons which lets it do unique sounds such as for Drumset there is a special button for a drumroll and rim hit. These special buttons will be specified in the instrcutions page for the corresponding instrument and the instrcution page also explains which keys correspond with what key aswell as what basic terms such as what octives mean. Also we added a section that lets the user reduce or increase their sound quickly.
