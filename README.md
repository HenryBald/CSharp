## Outline for CSharp - Santhosh 
Our idea for a application is a music creation app that allows the user to recreate sounds of a instrument of their choice which will be be implemmented homescreen and we will have a few options for instruments such as one for percussion, piano, and guitar which are options located in the homescreen and when the user hovers over anand clicks on one of the instrument it will take them to a new place that has the instrument and intructions on how to make the sound.
- We think we can implement the sound aspect of this using keycodes such as the ones used in the calculator app so each key represents a sound
- For example a piano that inputs each sound when you press the specific key.
- We also think that all the UI's are going to be madel in a pixel form to keep the visual mathcing with the logo.
