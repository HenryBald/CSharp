## Outline for CSharp - Santhosh 
(REWOKRED)
Libraries needed to download:
- Sound Library
- Minim Library
We created a music creator app which essentially lets the user click or press they mouse keys to recreate sounds of an instrument. The user can choose various different instruments in the homescreen; the options are drumset, piano, and guitar. We also have a metronome to let the user stay on beat on whatever music they are recreating and the metronome gives options to slow or fasten the BPM. Also some instrumenst may retain a special buttons which lets it do unique sounds such as for Drumset there is a special button for a drumroll and rim hit. These special buttons will be specified in the instrcutions page for the corresponding instrument. Also we added a section that lest the user reduce or increase their sound quickly.
